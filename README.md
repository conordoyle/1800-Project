# 1800-Project

A Northeastern University Discrete Structures (CS1800) final project.
Created by Conor Doyle, Karthik Yalala, and Jonah Lefkoff

This project contains code to render a series of animations made using the manim library. 

These have been recorded into a video that can be found here: [https://youtu.be/flpOVl-Y0eU](https://youtu.be/flpOVl-Y0eU)

To render the animation, install [manim](https://github.com/manimCommunity/manim) and [manim-pptx](https://github.com/yoshiask/manim-pptx). Then run: `python3 -m manim -pqh animation.py Slides`
